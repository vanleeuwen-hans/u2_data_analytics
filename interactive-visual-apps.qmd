## World map with interactive tour and song filter using Shiny

I created an interactive version of the world map so that the user can filter by tour and/or song. This was done with R-Shiny[@shiny] and deployed to shinyapps.io at: [U2 Tour Map](https://qjxo03-hans-van0leeuwen.shinyapps.io/u2_tour_map/).

The code of this Shiny app can be found in my GitHub repository at: <https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_tour_map>

## Tour setlist alignment with interactive tour filter using Shiny

I created an interactive version of the setlist alignment so that the user select a major U2 tour to see the alignment of 30 setlists from that tour. This was done with R-Shiny and deployed to shinyapps.io at: [U2 Setlist Alignment](https://qjxo03-hans-van0leeuwen.shinyapps.io/u2_setlist_alignment/).

The explanation of the method used for the alignment can be found in the MAFFT section on this page: [Multiple Setlist Alignment](multiple-setlist-alignment.qmd#tour-setlist-alignment)

The code of this Shiny app can be found in my GitHub repository at: <https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_setlist_alignment>\
