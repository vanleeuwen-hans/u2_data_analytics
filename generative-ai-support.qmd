## Examples

### Brainstorming ideas for data analytics and visuals

### Troubleshooting coding errors

### Advise for tools and hosting platforms

### Creating the structure for an R Package

### Automating the deployment of changes in the Quarto web site

As explained in the [Sharing \> Maintenance and Updates](sharing.qmd#maintenance-and-updates) section, I initially had a cumbersome process that involved many manual steps to push changes to my Quarto web site. That was until I asked Claude.AI (3.5 Sonnet) for help. Here was my prompt:\

> I have my R Studio project u2_data_analytics. I have a git repository locally and on GitHub. All the Quarto rendered files are in the docs folder and in the gh-pages branch, and published on GitHub pages. The rest is in the main branch.\
> \
> The process to update is currently cumbersome. I update qmd documents in main, render these, copy the new files from docs temporarily and manually somewhere outside of my project folder, then do a git stash, after which I switch to the gh-pages branch, then manually copy paste the new files into the docs folder of the gh-pages branch, followed by git add, commit and push.\
> \
> Is there a more automated way to deploy my qmd file changes to the Quarto site that is on GitHub pages?

This was Claude's response:

> I understand you want to streamline the process of updating your Quarto site deployed on GitHub Pages. Yes, there's a much simpler automated approach using GitHub Actions. Let me create a workflow file that will handle this automatically.
>
> GitHub Actions workflow for Quarto publishing (code was provided)
>
> To implement this automated workflow:
>
> Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository's main branch:
>
> ``` bash
> mkdir -p .github/workflows
> ```
>
> Save the workflow file I provided as `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml`
>
> Commit and push these changes to your main branch:
>
> ``` bash
> git add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml
> git commit -m "Add Quarto publishing workflow"
> git push origin main
> ```
>
> This workflow will:
>
> -   Trigger automatically when you push changes to .qmd, .Rmd, or .md files in the main branch
>
> -   Set up R and Quarto in the GitHub Actions environment
>
> -   Install your R dependencies using renv
>
> -   Render your Quarto project
>
> -   Automatically deploy the rendered files to the gh-pages branch
>
> Now your process becomes much simpler:
>
> 1.  Make changes to your Quarto documents in the main branch
>
> 2.  Commit and push to main
>
> 3.  GitHub Actions will automatically handle the rendering and deployment
>
> The changes should appear on your GitHub Pages site within a few minutes after pushing to main.
>
> Would you like me to explain any part of this workflow in more detail?

I implemented this but there was a failure on the first attempt. That was due to a missing renv.lock file in my repository. As Claude.AI had timed out (I have a free account) I went to Perplexity.AI who helped to resolve this issue:\

> The error "This project does not contain a lockfile" suggests that you're using a package management system (likely renv for R or pip for Python) but haven't created a lockfile yet. Here's how to resolve this:
>
> 1.  Locally, in your R project, run:
>
> ```         
> renv::snapshot()
> ```
>
> This will create a **`renv.lock`** file in your project directory.
>
> 2.  Commit and push the **`renv.lock`** file to your repository.

When I created the `renv.lock` file I got a warning about my local loading of my concertData R package, so I changed the loading of that package in my Quarto code chunks:

From: `devtools::load_all("../packages/concertData")`

To: `devtools::install_github("vanleeuwen-hans/concertData")`

And that was basically it, now the deployment is fully automated whenever I change something in my report qmd files and push it to GitHub.
