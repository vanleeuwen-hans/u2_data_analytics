This R package is available on my GitHub page at: <https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans>.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::load_all(\"../packages/concertData\")\nlibrary(concertData)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read the following file where the Rosemont duplication was not fixed yet\n# this is explained further down on this page\nu2data <- read_concertData_csv('u2data/archive/u2data_all_shows_clean_final_rosemontdup.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Longest set lists\n\nList the shows with the longest set lists, i.e. where U2 played most songs in a concert. The list corresponds to the statistics at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html>.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# longest set lists\nlongest_setlists <- find_longest_setlists(u2data)\nprint(longest_setlists)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        date    city country             venue Number of songs played\n1 2015-12-06   Paris  France AccorHotels Arena                     27\n2 2018-05-02   Tulsa     USA        BOK Center                     27\n3 2015-10-18 Cologne Germany     Lanxess Arena                     27\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe info at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html>:\n\n![Longest U2 set lists - source u2gigs.com - October 2024.](u2gigs/u2_longest_setlists-u2gigscom.png)\n\nOne of these shows, with 27 songs played, was in Cologne on October 18th, 2015. I was there with my wife, and before the show we had the chance to meet and greet with Adam Clayton, U2's bass player. He signed my copy of the 1991 Achtung Baby album. I have included some pictures of that moment below.\n\n![Meeting Adam Clayton in Cologne - source Hans van Leeuwen - 18 October 2015.](u2hvl/AdamClaytonCologne.JPG){width=\"208\"} ![Meeting Adam Clayton in Cologne - source Hans van Leeuwen - 18 October 2015.](u2hvl/HvLmeetandgreetAdamClayton.JPG){width=\"246\"} ![Meeting Adam Clayton in Cologne - source Hans van Leeuwen - 18 October 2015.](u2hvl/AchtungBaby_signed.JPG){width=\"162\"}\n\n## Shows with most snippets\n\nA snippet is a short piece of song (either from another artist or from U2 themselves) played as part of a regular song in the show.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get shows with most snippets\nsnippet_summary <- find_shows_with_most_snippets(u2data)\nhead(snippet_summary, n=10)  # Show top 10 shows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 10 Ã— 5\n   date       city     country          venue             number_snippets_played\n   <date>     <chr>    <chr>            <chr>                              <int>\n 1 2015-11-28 Dublin   Ireland          3Arena                                24\n 2 2015-11-19 Belfast  Northern Ireland The SSE Arena                         23\n 3 2015-10-30 London   England          The O2                                23\n 4 2015-11-24 Dublin   Ireland          3Arena                                20\n 5 2015-11-23 Dublin   Ireland          3Arena                                20\n 6 2015-11-03 London   England          The O2                                20\n 7 2015-05-19 San Jose USA              SAP Center at Saâ€¦                     20\n 8 2015-12-06 Paris    France           AccorHotels Arena                     19\n 9 2015-11-27 Dublin   Ireland          3Arena                                19\n10 1997-07-31 Mannheim Germany          Maimarkt                              19\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe info at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html>:\n\n![U2 shows with most snippets played - source u2gigs.com - October 2024.](u2gigs/u2_shows_most_snippets-u2gigscom.png)\n\nI noticed a discrepancy in number of snippets for some of these shows when comparing with the statistics at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html>, for example the London show on November 3rd, 2015, where my data calculates the number of snippets played as 20, while the info at <https://www.u2gigs.com/show1957.html> states 19.

It does explain the different numbers seen earlier as my scraping code has counted songs preceding songs with those tags as snippet incorrectly.\n\n## Cities with most shows\n\nWe used this metric for data curation already, but here is the top 11 (instead of Top 10 so that Amsterdam is displayed ðŸ˜€ ) of cities where U2 played most often.

When you click on one the songs in that list it shows a different number on the song page. For example, Zoo Station has the opening song count of 196 at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html> (see earlier screen shot), but 197 at <https://www.u2gigs.com/openingsong141.html>:\n\n![Zoo Station opening song - u2gigs.com - October 2024.](u2gigs/u2_zoo_station_opening.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nThus, it looks like u2gigs.com needs to refresh the 'Top 25 show opening songs' list at <https://www.u2gigs.com/tourdb-stats.html>.\n\nSecond, I observed a few rare cases on the u2gigs.com show pages which were not handled properly by my scraping code, or were not handled properly by u2gigs.com, for example:\n\n*Example 1:*\n\nOct 23rd, 2000 set list, <https://www.u2gigs.com/show1147.html>: ![Rare setlist format on show page.](u2gigs/u2_2000-10-23_setlist-u2gigscom.png)\n\nMy code and data did count Elevation as opening song for this 'show' while u2gigs.com did not count it, probably because it was preceded by an interview.\n\nThe same issue occurred with this show: <https://www.u2gigs.com/show1149.html>, and potentially with other shows as I only checked shows that opened with Elevation. u2gigs.com may want to check how they count opening songs in such case.\n\n*Example 2*\n\n2001-09-06 set list, <https://www.u2gigs.com/show1473.html>. In this case the set list started with a medley, with two songs as one entry. This is different than a regular song plus a snippet. My scraping code could apparently not handle this.\n\n![Rare setlist format on show page.](u2gigs/u2_2001-09-06_setlist-u2gigscom.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nI decided not to invest more time in trying to detect and fix these rare issues.\n",
