These data files were concatenated on the command line on MacOS using the following code.\n\n-   Resulting files from scraping of u2gigs.com:\n    -   u2analytics_data_shows1-234.csv\n    -   u2analytics_data_shows235-298.csv\n    -   u2analytics_data_shows299-2307.csv\n-   Now combine everything into one data file:\n    -   First create new file with header:\n        -   `head -n 1 u2analytics_data_shows1-234.csv > u2data_all_shows.csv`\n    -   Then concatenate content from 3 data files into the new file (skipping headers):\n        -   `tail -n +2 -q u2analytics_data_shows*.csv >> u2data_all_shows.csv`\n-   Check number of lines in original 3 files and final data file:\n-   `wc -l u2analytics_data_shows*`\n    -   2980 u2analytics_data_shows1-234.csv\n    -   1176 u2analytics_data_shows235-298.csv\n    -   35222 u2analytics_data_shows299-2307.csv\n    -   39378 total\n-   `wc -l u2data_all_shows.csv`\n    -   39376 u2data_all_shows.csv\n-   Difference is the header lines -\\> correct\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Importing the data into R for further curation\n\nThe data curation was an iterative process of checking the data, identifying issues, fixing the issues followed by another round of curation. The R code chunk below shows the multiple iterations that were done, followed by paragraphs explaining the issues that were observed and fixed in these iterations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Fix problems in song_lyrics field\n\nWhen reading the data file with read_csv() a problems attribute was created with 979 rows. There were many rows from the file that have an unexpected number of columns. I manually inspected a sample of these lines in the original data file.\n\nThen I checked three lines that give a problem with read_csv, focusing on the song_lyrics field:\n\n``` bash\nsed '2981!d' u2data_all_shows.csv \nsed '1150!d' u2data_all_shows.csv\nsed '115!d' u2data_all_shows.csv\n```\n\nI found different issues in the song_lyrics field:\n\n-   \"\";; at the end of the line instead of a single \"\n-   \" escaped quote characters in the song_lyrics field\n\nI used the following awk commands on MacOS to fix these two issues:\n\n``` bash\nawk '{gsub(/\\\\\"/,\"\")}1' u2data_all_shows.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes.csv\nawk '{gsub(/\";;/,\"\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv\n```\n\n## Fix invalid date issue\n\nIn the file 18 lines were found where an invalid date was present with 00 for the day. I used a MacOS command line to fix this on the data file:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\\-00' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv |  wc -l\n      18\nawk '{gsub(/\\-00/,\"-01\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv\ngrep '\\-00' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv | wc -l                                     \n       0\n```\n\n## Fix additional issues in the song_lyrics field\n\nFile was read again with read_csv() and problems() showed that there were still 30 lines with a problem. Here the most likely culprits are again in the song_lyrics field.\n\n-   an extra \" at the end of the line\n\nFix the extra \" at the end of the line:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\"\"\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv | wc -l\n      8\nawk '{gsub(/\"\"\\r/,\"\\\\\\\"\\r\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv\ngrep '\"\"\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv | wc -l\n       0\n```\n\nLoading the file with read_csv() shows that now the file still has 23 problem lines. Inspecting some problem lines, I observed the following potential issues in the song_lyrics field:\n\n-   \";\"\n-   \"\"; at the end of the line Fixed this in the following manner:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\";\"' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv | wc -l\n      22\ngrep '\"\";\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv | wc -l\n      22\n      \nawk '{gsub(/\";\"/,\"\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-2.csv\n\nawk '{gsub(/\"\";\\r/,\"\\\\\\\"\\r\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-2.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv\n\ngrep '\";\"' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv | wc -l\n      0\ngrep '\"\";\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv | wc -l\n      0\n```\n\nLoading the file with read_csv() shows that now the file still has 1 problem line. I observed that two lines were concatenated, meaning that the carriage return character was missing. Here is the part of the line that shows this:\n\n``` bash\nsed '4156!d' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv\nw I will follow...  \"299,\"U2 Unforgettable Fire Tour\",\"T\n```\n\nFixed this in the following manner:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\"299,' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv | wc -l\n      1\nawk '{gsub(/\"299,/,\"\\\"\\n299,\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-3.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-4.csv\n\ngrep '\"299,' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-4.csv | wc -l\n      1\n      \nsed '4156!d' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-4.csv  \nsed '4157!d' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-4.csv  \n```\n\n## Data cleaning result\n\nReading the last fixed file with read_csv() gave 0 errors and the following info:\n\n```         \nRows: 39376 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (10): tour, leg, venue, city, state, country, song_title, show_url, song_url, song_lyrics\ndbl   (2): showID, song_position\nlgl   (2): snippet, encore\ndate  (1): date\n```\n\nI stored this fixed data file with a better file name:\n\n``` bash\ncp u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others-4.csv u2data_all_shows_clean.csv\n```\n",
