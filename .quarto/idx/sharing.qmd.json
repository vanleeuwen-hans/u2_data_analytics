More about the set-up in the next paragraph. Example R Code chunks with my analysis code and outputs can be seen at my [U2 Data Analytics](https://vanleeuwen-hans.github.io/u2_data_analytics/) Quarto web site.\n\n## Quarto Report on GitHub Pages\n\nTo write my report for the Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project I first experimented with basic [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) pages, but then switched to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) which was easy having a report with multiple pages, and it is convenient to share and publish it on GitHub Pages. Basically, the Quarto Report that you are reading now was created as I advanced in my project, and includes all the analysis steps. The report pages are automatically rendered at which point the analysis code is executed and the resulting output, tables or plots are included in the report page. The structure of the report is created in the \\_quarto.yml file in the R Studio project folder, and then the individual Quarto documents with the sections of the report are automatically linked into one web site.\n\nThe initial push of my rendered Quarto documents to my GitHub repository and GitHub Pages was a challenge as there were many files, including images, and the total size made the process fail. Here is how I set it up:\n\nIn my GitHub account I created a new repository: [u2_data_analytics](https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_data_analytics), with nothing in it. In the Settings \\> Pages section I selected to deploy from the gh-pages branch (see below) and from the docs folder. That is the Folder where Quarto renders and creates the website files.\n\nLocally, in the folder of my R Studio project u2_data_analytics, I worked on the MacOS terminal:\n\n```         \n# initialise git repository locally\n% git init \nInitialized empty Git repository in u2_data_analytics/.git/\n\n# link it to the online GitHuB repository\n% git remote add origin https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_data_analytics.git\n\n# pull from remote main branch\n% git pull origin main \nFrom https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_data_analytics \n* branch main -> FETCH_HEAD\n\n# create gh-pages branch that will be used for publishing Quarto Report pages only\n% git checkout -b gh-pages \nSwitched to a new branch 'gh-pages'\n\n# Push the new branch to remote\n\n% git push origin gh-pages \nTotal 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 remote: \nremote: Create a pull request for 'gh-pages' on GitHub by visiting: remote: https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_data_analytics/pull/new/gh-pages remote: \nTo https://github.com/vanleeuwen-hans/u2_data_analytics.git \\* \\[new branch\\] gh-pages -\\> gh-pages\n\n# Set upstream to track remote branch\n# Pushes your local gh-pages branch to the remote repository (origin) \n# 2 Sets up tracking between your local and remote branch, which means: \n# ◦ Future git pull commands will know to pull from origin/gh-pages \n# ◦ Future git push commands will know to push to origin/gh-pages \n# ◦ You can see the branch's status compared to remote with git status \n# Without setting the upstream, you'd need to type git push origin gh-pages every time. \n# After setting it, you can simply type git push or git pull. \n% git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages \nbranch 'gh-pages' set up to track 'origin/gh-pages'.
