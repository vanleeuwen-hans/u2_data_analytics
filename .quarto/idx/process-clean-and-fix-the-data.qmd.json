There were many rows from the file that have an unexpected number of columns. I manually inspected a sample of these lines in the original data file.\n\nThen I checked three lines that give a problem with read_csv, focusing on the song_lyrics field:\n\n``` bash\nsed '2981!d' u2data_all_shows.csv \nsed '1150!d' u2data_all_shows.csv\nsed '115!d' u2data_all_shows.csv\n```\n\nI found different issues in the song_lyrics field:\n\n-   \"\";; at the end of the line instead of a single \"\n-   \" escaped quote characters in the song_lyrics field\n\nI used the following awk commands on MacOS to fix these two issues:\n\n``` bash\nawk '{gsub(/\\\\\"/,\"\")}1' u2data_all_shows.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes.csv\nawk '{gsub(/\";;/,\"\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv\n```\n\n## Fix invalid date issue\n\nIn the file 18 lines were found where an invalid date was present with 00 for the day. I used a MacOS command line to fix this on the data file:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\\-00' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv |  wc -l\n      18\nawk '{gsub(/\\-00/,\"-01\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv\ngrep '\\-00' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv | wc -l                                     \n       0\n```\n\n## Fix additional issues in the song_lyrics field\n\nFile was read again with read_csv() and problems() showed that there were still 30 lines with a problem. Here the most likely culprits are again in the song_lyrics field.\n\n-   an extra \" at the end of the line\n\nFix the extra \" at the end of the line:\n\n``` bash\ngrep '\"\"\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv | wc -l\n      8\nawk '{gsub(/\"\"\\r/,\"\\\\\\\"\\r\")}1' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates.csv > u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv\ngrep '\"\"\\r' u2data_all_shows_fixquotes-semicolons-dates-others.csv | wc -l\n       0\n```\n\nLoading the file with read_csv() shows that now the file still has 23 problem lines.
